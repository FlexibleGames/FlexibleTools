# Flexible Tools
A mod for Vintage Story https://mods.vintagestory.at/show/mod/3103

## Details
Adds some very helpful if very expensive tools to the game. Each tool tackles a different aspect of the game to help players.
- Diamond Scythe - Offers THE best harvest areas. Clear a 3x3 to 9x9 area of grass or your farm. Use "F" to set modes.
- Diamond Shears - Clears leaves in a 3x3x3 to 9x9x9 area.
- Item Magnet - A necklace-like Torc you place on your character. This was a fun (and challenging) item to program and is SUPER helpful. When worn, it pulls in items around you in a (configurable) 5 block radius.
- Rock Sniffer - A QoL item that only reports unique rock types below the rock block broken. May also report oil, if you have that mod installed. It does not give depth information.
- Diamond Tipped Steel Pickaxe - Is just that. A tough pickaxe and primarily used to craft:
- World Eater - A true BEAST of a tool. Breaks everything with ease (think paxel). Offers 3x3 and 5x5 clearing options as well as **VEIN MINING** of ores, clay, sand, gravel, snow, ice, and peat, and trees. This will fill your inventory very fast.

## Performance
To prevent your FPS from crashing when using the world eater the tool attempts to place block drops directly into the players inventory. It will only drop items on the ground if the player is full. Before you vein mine something, ensure you have plenty of inventory space available.
